		<p> Security breaches in the healthcare sector more than tripled in the past decade. 2020 alone saw a 30% increase of breaches from the previous year. These incidents were increasingly a result of hacking or IT methods, revealing the sector’s need for cybersecurity.</p>
		<p> Breach incidents of unsecured protected health information, which affect more than 500 people, must be reported to the U.S. Health and Human Services and published on their <a href="https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach/breach_report.jsf" target="_blank">Breach Portal</a>.</p>
	<h3>The pandemic's increased breaches</h3>
		<p> In the past five years, health information security breaches increased by 145%. As COVID-19 spurred a shift to remote work, 2020 had the highest number of individual incidents so far.</p>
		<p> "During the same period of transition and disruption, threat actors shifted their techniques to target employees through COVID-themed phishing and social engineering campaigns to capitalize on the stress and anxiety of the pandemic situation,” Verizon Chief Information Security Officer Nasrin Rezaisaid in a <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ransomware-phishing-cybercrime-pandemic/" target="_blank">CBS News article</a>.</p>

					<p> Aja Anderson, a customer success manager at Paubox, saw an influx of customers trying to respond to these challenges. Paubox is a HIPPA compliant email encryption software company that uses the breach portal’s data as a value proposition for their software.</p>
					<p>Anderson was not surprised 2020 had the most breaches so far because the transition left people vulnerable. </p>
					<p>The expanded remote workforce increased the number and severity of cyber attacks, according to a 2021 <a href="https://enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/2021-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf" target="_blank">data breach report</a> by Verizon. The report noted increased ransomware attacks, as cyber criminals demanded payment, usually in cryptocurrency.</p>

				<p>Almost a third of cybersecurity professionals worldwide reported that their organizations made their workforce remote in a single day, according to the 2020 <a href="https://www.isc2.org/-/media/ISC2/Research/2020/Workforce-Study/ISC2ResearchDrivenWhitepaperFINAL.ashx?la=en&hash=2879EE167ACBA7100C330429C7EBC623BAF4E07B" target="_blank">(ISC)2 Cybersecurity Workforce Study</a>. 22% of them had less than one day to ensure that remote systems were secured.</p>
</section>
		<h3>Consequences of a breach</h3>
		<p>The average cost of a data breach was more than a million dollars higher when remote work was a causing factor compared to when it was not, according to IBM Security’s 2021 Cost of a Data Breach report. Specifically for healthcare data breaches, the average total cost increased by about two million dollars in 2021.</p>
		<div class="container-fluid">
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-md-5 linkcolor">
				<p>There is more than just a financial cost. Despite having more incidents, 2020 saw a decrease in the total number of individuals affected by them compared to 2019. </p>
				<p>In the past several years, 2015 had the highest number of individuals affected, with over 100 million, due to a few extremely large incidents. The infamous <a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/tech/anthem-to-pay-39m-to-state-ags-to-settle-landmark-2015-data-breach" target="_blank">Anthem breach</a> affected almost 80 million people that year.</p>
				<p>“Nobody wants to end up on that ‘Wall of Shame’ because it means that their data’s been compromised and therefore human beings, their lives, their protected data, is in the hands of someone it shouldn't be,” Anderson said.</p>

				 <p>The “Wall of Shame” for the breach portal is a controversial name. “It’s not nice to call people out, to shame them when a breach has happened because in some ways it's not their fault but in other ways it is,” she said.</p>

		<h3>The healthcare sector's cybersecurity issue</h3>
			<p>In 2020, the WHO reported a <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/23-04-2020-who-reports-fivefold-increase-in-cyber-attacks-urges-vigilance"target="_blank">fivefold increase</a> in the number of cyber attacks directed at the organization since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the same period in 2019.</p>
			<p>The healthcare sector has dealt with security concerns for years. “Healthcare organizations experienced the highest average cost of a data breach, for the eleventh year in a row,” according to the 2021 IBM Security report.</p>
			<p>Bill Spooner became passionate about healthcare cybersecurity during his 35 years as a CIO at Sharp Rees-Stealy Medical Group. His interest grew after the organization experienced a security breach in 2006.</p>
			<p>“You got to think about not just the impact on getting the IT program back in line, but how about the patients that are trying to get care,” he said.</p>
			<p>For Anderson, she noticed a lot of healthcare network servers are old, leaving them vulnerable. She described it like an arms race, as healthcare security innovation struggles to keep pace with their attackers.</p>
			<p>“Healthcare is pretty slow to innovate. That's because, you know, they’re trying to stay compliant, but the problem is bad actors, hackers, whatever you call them, they are innovating really quickly," she said.</p>
	<h3>America's cyber pandemic</h3>
		<p>For the past 11 years, the U.S. was the top country for the highest average total cost of a data breach, according to IBM Security.</p> 
		<p>Although technology allowed companies, schools and organizations to continue during the pandemic, concerns about a <a href="https://www.govtech.com/blogs/lohrmann-on-cybersecurity/is-a-cyber-pandemic-coming.html" target="_blank">Cyber Pandemic</a> have worsened by the increasing reliance on technology.</p>
	<div class="container-fluid">
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-5">
			<p>In 2015, thefts accounted for almost half of all breach incidents, while hacking/IT incidents were about a third of them. In 2020, thefts became less than 8% of all breaches, and hacking/IT incidents increased to about 86% of them.</p>
			<p>Anderson also noticed the frequency of hacking/IT attacks increased, with many occurring through network servers and around the holidays.</p>
			<p>“I think human error is overwhelmingly related to the overall problem, and we don't think it’s going to happen to us,” Anderson said. “We don't think our organization is important enough to be targeted.”</p>

			<iframe title="Increased IT/Hacking in healthcare sector security breaches" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-APnD7" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/APnD7/11/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script>

			<p>Spooner saw various cybersecurity approaches when advising different organizations in the U.S. With breaches taking systems offline for days, Spooner encouraged organizations to take external audits for their security seriously.</p>

	<h3>Cybersecurity workforce concerns</h3>
		<p>Despite an increased number of entrants into the cybersecurity workforce, their high demand has not been met. This has created the Cybersecurity Workforce Gap, which has narrowed in recent years, according to the <a href="https://www.isc2.org//-/media/ISC2/Research/2021/ISC2-Cybersecurity-Workforce-Study-2021.ashx"target="_blank">2021 (ISC)2 Cybersecurity Workforce Study.</a></p>
		<p>“Cybersecurity professionals say the workforce gap remains the number one barrier to meeting their security needs,” the study found.</p>
		<p>Consequences of a cybersecurity staff shortage include “misconfigured systems, slow patch cycles, rushed deployments, not enough time for proper risk assessment, not enough oversight of processes and procedures, and more,” the study explained.</p>
	<h3> Moving forward</h3>
		<p>Some protective measures Anderson recommended included educating employees, backing up data and keeping software up to date. She also encouraged routine risk assessments, which the HHS has templates for.</p>
		<p>“We know the problem exists, clearly, we see the data on the ‘Wall of Shame’, but convincing folks that they need this solution before they actually experience a problem is a challenge,” she said.</p>
		<p>The number of breaches in 2021 has already outpaced 2020, Anderson said. There have been many ransomware attacks through phishing schemes and network server breaches.</p>
		<p>Spooner said the healthcare industry needs “something to light a fire” under them to realign their focus on the importance of cybersecurity. He suggested federal regulation as one way to do this.</p>
		<p>“The unfortunate thing is that organizations tend to increase their focus on cybersecurity after they’ve had a breach,” Spooner said. “But you’d have to hope that some would realize that when their neighbor has a breach, that they should take that to heart as well.”</p>
